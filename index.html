                <p>
                    You can create a Facebook business page for your company, and then promote it on other social media platforms, paper advertising, or on your website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can post anything you want on a Facebook page and there is no limit to how often. You won't be paying for the content like you would with newspaper ads or other traditional marketing tactics, which saves your company money.

                    Facebook is the fastest growing social media site in the world - it has 1 billion active users!
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If you're not on Facebook, then your customers may be. And they're looking for businesses just like yours to support with their dollars and time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Facebook is the only social media site that has a built-in ecommerce platform called facebook stores, which can increase customer engagement and offers an opportunity for more sales conversions at no cost.
                </p>

                    You don't have to worry about managing multiple accounts for different platforms because everything is consolidated into one account!

                <p>
                    Short on time? Facebook Business Suite can post directly to your Instagram account, and, you can even make slightly different posts for each platform to include different captions.
                </p>

                    Facebook has a sophisticated advertising platform that allows for targeted ads.
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Even if you don't plan to do any advertising now, you may want to in the future.  Going through the steps of getting your account set up correctly now will make it easier to do later, and you'll know how the system works.
